DSBA 6500,Complex Adaptive Systems,,"Complex adaptive systems (CAS) are networked (agents/part interact with their neighbors and, occasionally, distant agents), nonlinear (the whole is greater than the sum of its parts), adaptive (the system learns to change with its environment), open (new resources are being introduced into the environment), dynamic (the change is a norm), emergent (new, unplanned features of the system get introduced through the interaction of its parts/agents), and self-organizing (the parts organize themselves into a hierarchy of subsystems of various complexity).  Ant colonies, networks of neurons, the immune system, the Internet, social institutions, organization of cities, and the global economy are a few examples where the behavior of the whole is much more complex than the behavior of the parts.  Covers those and similar topics in an interactive manner.  Examples of our current research effort are provided.  Topics include:  Self-organization; emergent properties; learning; agents; localization affect; adaptive systems; nonlinear behavior; chaos; complexity."
