DS-GA 1003,Machine Learning,https://davidrosenberg.github.io/ml2016/#home,"The course covers a wide variety of topics in machine learning, pattern recognition, statistical modeling, and neural computation. It covers the mathematical methods and theoretical aspects, but primarily focuses on algorithmic and practical issues."
DS-GA 1004,Big Data,,"Big Data requires the storage, organization, and processing of data at a scale and efficiency that go well beyond the capabilities of conventional information technologies. In this course, we will study the state of the art in big data management: we will learn about algorithms, techniques and tools needed to support big data processing. In addition, we will examine real applications that require massive data analysis and how they can be implemented on Big Data platforms. The course will consist of lectures based both on textbook material and scientific papers. It will also include programming assignments that will provide students with hands-on experience on building data-intensive applications using existing Big Data platforms, including Amazon AWS. Besides lectures given by the instructor, we will also have guest lectures by experts in some of the topics we will cover."

The pre-requisites include: DS-GA 1001 Intro to Data Science or a graduate-level machine learning course. Class Notes: Restricted to DS-GA students. Non-DS students should contact the department about registering for this course. Pre-requisite includes DS-GA 1001 Introduction to Data Science or a graduate-level machine learning course. Enrollment Requirements: Restr for DS-GA Blank."
DS-GA 1011,Natural Language Process with Representation Learning,,"How should human languages be understood and analyzed? This course examines modern computational approaches based on representation learning for understanding, processing and using human language. These include neural network-based deep learning methods and vector-space models of word meaning, and together will give the tools to build state-of-the-art models for hard language understanding tasks like translation. "
DS-GA 1012,Natural Language Understanding and Computational Semantics,,"Since at least the proposal of the Turing test, building computational systems that can communicate with humans using natural language has been a central goal for Al research. Understanding real, naturally occurring human language is the key to reaching this goal. This course surveys recent successes in languageunderstanding and prepares students to do original research in this area, culminating with a substantial final project.The course will focus on text, but within that will touch on the full range of applicable techniques for language understanding, including formal logics, statistical methods, distributional methods, and deep learning, and will bring inideas from formal linguistics where they can be readily used in practice. We'll discuss tasks like sentiment analysis, word similarity, and question answering, as well as higher level issues like how to effectively represent language meaning. "
DS-GA 1013,Optimization-based Data Analysis,,"This course provides a unifying description of optimization-based methods designed to tackle data-analysis problems, including spare regression, compressed sensing, super-resolution, matrix completion, clustering and manifold learning. The course will analyze large techniques from a mathematical and algorithmic point of view and describe their application to a wide range of practical problems."
