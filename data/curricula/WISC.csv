Math 234,Calculus - Functions of Several Variables,https://www.math.wisc.edu/234-Calculus-Functions-Several-Variables,
Math 421,Single Variable Calculus,http://www.math.wisc.edu/421-Theory-Single-Variable-Calculus,
Stat 601,Statistical Methods I,https://www.stat.wisc.edu/course/statistical-methods-i,"Together with STAT 602, this course is to provide graduate students in statistics and related quantitative fields with a thorough grounding in modern statistical methods. The specific learning outcomes for the course are to understand data collection in context (how/why data were collected, key questions under study); explore data by effective graphical and numerical summaries; understand probability concepts and models as tools for studying random phenomena and for statistical inference; analyze data using appropriate, modern statistical models, methods, and software; understand the statistical concepts underlying methods; develop the ability to interpret results and critically evaluate the methods used; communicate data analysis and key findings in context. This course will assume students have had at least one semester of calculus and one semester of linear algebra."

Stat 610,Introduction to Statistical Inference,,
Stat 627,Professional Skills in Data Science,https://www.stat.wisc.edu/course/professional-skills-data-science,"This topics course is aimed at providing statistics graduate students with an understanding of and experience with important aspects of professional development in statistics, including skills with internet tools, sophisticated use of statistical languages (such as R) and other emerging topics."
Stat 628,Data Science Practicum,https://www.stat.wisc.edu/course/data-science-practicum,"This course is aimed at providing graduate students with an understanding of and experience with turning statistics concepts into practice through data science practicums inspired by realistic projects. Students will combine theory and methods expertise with communications skills to translate from a vaguely stated project description and complex data set into a concisely summarized analysis, including both written and graphical interpretation that can be used by decision makers in an organization."
Stat 349,Introduction to Time Series,https://www.stat.wisc.edu/node/2078,"Autocorrelation; stationarity and non-stationarity; heteroscedasticity; dynamic models; auto-regressive and moving average models; identification and fitting; forecasting; seasonal adjustment; applications for financial time series, social sciences and environmental studies."
Stat 351,Introductory Nonparametric Statistics,https://www.stat.wisc.edu/node/2079,"Distribution free statistical procedures or methods valid under nonrestrictive assumptions: basic tools; counting methods; order statistics, ranks, empirical distribution functions; distribution free tests and associated interval and point estimators; sign test; signed rank tests; rank tests; Mann Whitney Wilcoxon procedures; Kolmogorov Smirnov tests; permutation methods; kernel density estimation; kernel and spline regression estimation; computer techniques and programs; discussion and comparison with parametric methods..."
Stat 411,An Introduction to Sample Survey Theory and Methods,https://www.stat.wisc.edu/node/2081,"An introduction to the methods used to design sample surveys and analyze the results. Topics covered include: basic tools, simple random sampling, ratio and regression estimation, stratification, systematic sampling, cluster (area) sampling, two-stage sampling, unequal probability sampling, non-sampling errors, and missing data. For illustration and clarification, examples are drawn from diverse areas of application."
Stat 421,Applied Categorical Data Analysis,https://www.stat.wisc.edu/node/2082,"Analysis of multidimensional contingency tables, Poisson regression, and logistic regression, with emphasis on practical applications. Use of computer programs for such analyses. Model selection, testing goodness of fit, estimation of parameters, measures of association and methods for detecting sources of significance."
Stat 456,Applied Multivariate Analysis,https://www.stat.wisc.edu/node/2084,Theory and applications of multivariate statistical methods. Basic concepts and statistical reasoning which underlie the techniques of multivariate analysis. Ideas rather than derivations stressed although basic models discussed to give the student some feeling for their adequacy in particular situations. Acquaintance with and use of existing computer programs in the multivariate analysis area.
Stat 461,Financial Statistics,https://www.stat.wisc.edu/course/financial-statistics,"This course will cover financial stochastic models and their statistical inferences with applications to volatility analysis and risk management. It will introduce discrete models such as binomial trees and GARCH and stochastic volatility models as well as simple continuous models like the Black-Scholes model. The main focus of the course will be on statistical inference, data analysis and risk management regarding these models."
Stat 471,Introduction to Computational Statistics,https://www.stat.wisc.edu/node/2085,"Course Description: Classical statistical procedures arise where closed-form mathematical expressions are available for various inference summaries (e.g. linear regression; analysis of variance). A major emphasis of modern statistics is the development of inference principles in cases where both more complex data structures are involved and where more elaborate computations are required. Topics from numerical linear algebra, optimization, Monte Carlo (including Markov chain Monte Carlo), and graph theory are developed, especially as they relate to statistical inference (e.g., bootstrapping, permutation, Bayesian inference, EM algorithm, multivariate analysis)."
