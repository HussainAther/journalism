HS 650,Data Science and Predictive Analytics,http://predictive.space/,"The course aims to build computational abilities, inferential thinking, and practical skills for tackling core data scientific challenges. It explores foundational concepts in data management, processing, statistical computing, and dynamic visualization using modern programming tools and agile web-services. Concepts, ideas, and protocols are illustrated through examples of real observational, simulated and research-derived datasets. Some prior quantitative experience in programming, calculus, statistics, mathematical models, or linear algebra will be necessary."

The course revolves around three issues in optimization: building optimization models of problems, characterization of their solutions, and algorithms for finding these solutions. As the semester progresses, I will compile a list of topics of each lecture on the web site. The outline of the topics cover: Introduction to optimization, optimality conditions for unconstrained problems, algorithms for unconstrained problems (steepest descent, Newtonâ€™s, etc.) and analysis of their convergence, optimality conditions and constraint qualifications for constrained problems, convexity and its role in optimization, algorithms for constrained problems (SQP, barrier and penalty methods, etc.), conic optimization problems, their applications, and methods for their solution."
