STAT GU4203,PROBABILITY THEORY,http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/STAT/GU4203-20181-001/,"An introductory course (STAT UN1201, preferably) is strongly recommended. A calculus-based introduction to probability theory. A quick review of multivariate calculus is provided. Topics covered include random variables, conditional probability, expectation, independence, Bayes’ rule, important distributions, joint distributions, moment generating functions, central limit theorem, laws of large numbers and Markov’s inequality.",
CSOR W4246,ALGORITHMS FOR DATA SCIENCE,,"Methods for organizing data, e.g. hashing, trees, queues, lists,priority queues. Streaming algorithms for computing statistics on the data. Sorting and searching. Basic graph models and algorithms for searching, shortest paths, and matching. Dynamic programming. Linear and convex programming. Floating point arithmetic, stability of numerical algorithms, Eigenvalues, singular values, PCA, gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and block coordinate descent. Conjugate gradient, Newton and quasi-Newton methods. Large scale applications from signal processing, collaborative filtering, recommendations systems, etc.",
STAT GR5703,STATISTICAL INFERENCE AND MODELING,,"In this course, we will systematically cover fundamentals of statistical inference and modeling, with special attention to models and methods that address practical data issues. The course will be focused on inference and modeling approaches such as the EM algorithm, MCMC methods and Bayesian modeling, linear regression models, generalized linear regression models, nonparametric regressions, and statistical computing. In addition, the course will provide introduction to statistical methods and modeling that addresses various practical issues such as design of experiments, analysis of time-dependent data,  missing values, etc. Throughpout the course, real-data examples will be used in lecture discussion and homework problems. This course lays the statistical foundation for inference and modeling using data, preparing the MS in Data Science students, for other courses in machine learning, data mining and visualization.",
COMS W4121,COMPUTER SYSTEMS FOR DATA SCIENCE,http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/COMS/W4121-20181-001/," An introduction to computer architecture and distributed systems with an emphasis on warehouse scale computing systems. Topics will include fundamental tradeoffs in computer systems, hardware and software techniques for exploiting instruction-level parallelism, data-level parallelism and task level parallelism, scheduling, caching, prefetching, network and memory architecture, latency and throughput optimizations, specialization, and an introduction to programming data center computers.",
COMS W4721,MACHINE LEARNING FOR DATA SCIENCE,http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/COMS/W4721-20181-001/,,
STAT GR5702,EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION,http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/STAT/GR5702-20181-001/,"This course covers visual approaches to exploratory data analysis, with a focus on graphical techniques for finding patterns in high dimensional datasets. We consider data from a variety of fields, which may be continuous, categorical, hierarchical, temporal, and/or spatial in nature. We cover visual approaches to selecting, interpreting, and evaluating models/algorithms such as linear regression, time series analysis, clustering, and classification.",
