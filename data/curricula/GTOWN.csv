,Advanced Programming Topics,,"The Analytics program gives an asynchronous, online course in programming preparation that covers R, Python, and command line use in the summer prior to matriculation. The course is equivalent to three credits, is designed for matriculating MS Analytics students, and is offered free of charge. It is required for incoming students who do not have a computer science degree and adequate preparation. Students admitted to the program will only have this requirement waived with approval from the Program Director (Todd Leen) or Program Coordinator (Heather Connor). This course will run during Georgetown Summer Session II (July 10 - August 11). Students must complete this course to matriculate in the fall unless granted a waiver by the program.",
