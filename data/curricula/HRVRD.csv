AC 209A,Data Science 1: Introduction to Data Science,https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/29726/,"Data Science 1 is the first half of a one-year introduction to data science. The course will focus on the analysis of messy, real life data to perform predictions using statistical and machine learning methods. Material covered will integrate the five key facets of an investigation using data: (1) data collection - data wrangling, cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set; (2) data management - accessing data quickly and reliably; (3) exploratory data analysis – generating hypotheses and building intuition; (4) prediction or statistical learning; and (5) communication – summarizing results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries. Note: Only one of CS 109a, AC 209a, or Stat 121a can be taken for credit. Students who have previously taken CS 109, AC 209, or Stat 121 cannot take CS 109a, AC 209a, or Stat 121a for credit. Programming knowledge at the level of CS 50 or above, and statistics knowledge at the level of Stat 100 or above (Stat 110 recommended)."
AC 209B,Data Science 2: Advanced Topics in Data Science,,"Data Science 2 is the second half of a one-year introduction to data science. Building upon the material in Data Science 1, the course introduces advanced methods for data wrangling, data visualization, and statistical modeling and prediction. Topics include big data and database management, interactive visualizations, nonlinear statistical models, and deep learning. Note: Can only be taken after successful completion of CS 109a, AC 209a, Stat 121a, or equivalent. Students who have previously taken CS 109, AC 209, or Stat 121 cannot take CS 109b, AC 209b, or Stat 121b for credit. CS 109a, AC 209a, or Stat 121a required."
AM 207,"Advanced Scientific Computing: Stochastic Methods for Data Analysis, Inference and Optimization",https://am207.github.io/2017/,"Develops skills for computational research with focus on stochastic approaches, emphasizing implementation and examples. Stochastic methods make it feasible to tackle very diverse problems when the solution space is too large to explore systematically, or when microscopic rules are known, but not the macroscopic behavior of a complex system. Methods will be illustrated with examples from a wide variety of fields, like biology, finance, and physics."
CS 207,Systems Development for Computational Science,https://iacs-cs-207.github.io/cs207-F17/,"This is a project-based course emphasizing designing, building, testing, maintaining and modifying software for scientific computing. Students will work in groups on a number of projects, ranging from small data-transformation utilities to large-scale systems. Students will learn to use a variety of tools and languages, as well as various techniques for organizing teams. Most important, students will learn to fit tools and approaches to the problem being solved."
AC 297r,Computational Science and Engineering Capstone Project,http://iacs-courses.seas.harvard.edu/courses/ac297r/,"The CSE capstone project is intended to integrate and apply the skills and ideas CSE students acquire in their core courses and electives. By requiring students to complete a substantial and challenging collaborative project, the capstone course will prepare students for the professional world and ensure that they are trained to conduct research. There will be no homework or lectures. Students will be dealing with real-world problems, messy data sets, and the chance to work on an end-to-end solution to a problem using computational methods."
